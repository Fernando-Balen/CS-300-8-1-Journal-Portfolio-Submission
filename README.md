**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

For the projects in this course, I was tasked with analyzing and optimizing data structures to manage and sort multiple csv lists with different sizes. The primary challenge was to ensure efficient runtime and memory usage for operations such as searching, sorting, and accessing information.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by first understanding the specific requirements for managing the data, such as how often the data would be accessed or updated. Recognizing that different data structures offer varying benefits depending on the operation (e.g., searching vs. insertion/deletion times), I analyzed the trade-offs between them. Understanding data structures is crucial because they are foundational to optimizing performance and resource usage in software development.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Whenever I encountered roadblocks, such as difficulties in optimizing a particular data structure for the data, I revisited the theory behind the data structure to understand its limitations better. I also sought feedback from my instructor and experimented with different approaches, such as adjusting algorithms or trying alternative data structures to find the best solution.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project has significantly expanded my approach to software design and development by deepening my understanding of how data structures and algorithms can impact a program's performance and scalability. I have learned to consider not just the immediate requirements but also how choices made early in the design process can affect future modifications and the overall maintainability of the software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

My work on this project has taught me to prioritize writing code that is not only functional but also clean, well-documented, and adaptable to future changes. I've become more diligent in commenting my code, choosing descriptive variable names, and structuring my programs in a way that makes them easier to understand and modify. This project reinforced the importance of designing with both current and future requirements in mind, ensuring the software remains usable over time.
